2-Step Verification APP for Windows

I have created a 2-step verification application for windows.

The program origin is based on React components and then ported with Tauri for Windows.

The program is kept lean and is about 5.4mb in size.

The entered data is stored in the folder "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\com.2fa-app".

If you have any wishes or suggestions, please let me know
