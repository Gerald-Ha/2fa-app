# 2-Step Verification APP for Windows

## Overview

I am excited to introduce my latest creation: a 2-step verification application for Windows. This lightweight program enhances your security by providing an additional layer of authentication, all while maintaining a small footprint.

## Technical Details

- **Technology Stack:** 
  - Built using React components
  - Seamlessly ported to Windows using Tauri
- **Size:** 
  - Optimized and has a minimal size of approximately 5.4 MB
- **Data Storage:** 
  - All entered data is securely stored in the directory: `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\com.2fa-app`
- **Secret Key Management:** 
  - Import and export secret keys
  - Encrypted using the CryptoJS module: `import CryptoJS from 'crypto-js';`

## Backup and Security

Through encryption, you can create secure backups of your secret keys. This ensures that even if your backup files are compromised, the encryption keeps your sensitive information protected.
